# A Beginner's Guide to Korean Hip-Hop

## Introduction

Since its arrival to Korea in the 90s, hip-hop has grown from a gimmick used in dance songs to a mainstay in the music industry, [usually occupying 10 to 15](https://circlechart.kr/page_article/view.circle?sgenre=opinion&idx=20183) of the top 100 songs in a given year. It has also seen a rise in global visibility, thanks in part to [viral tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPC9erC5WqU) as well as [heavy use in K-pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTlv5_Bs8aw). Just like in the United States, hip-hop is a very diverse genre comprised of distinctive visual and musical styles. and the scene has ballooned to encompass dozens of agencies and networks and hundreds of artists. With such a proliferation of entities – and without a significant push to reach Western audiences – it can be a difficult scene to get to know, and it's not very obvious where to begin. This page is intended to provide a general overview of the hip-hop industry in Korea, identifying important names to know and trends to follow, while setting the foundation for readers to explore more on their own.

## What this page isn't... and what it is

This page is **not** a history of hip-hop in Korea. While we briefly overview the 90's and 00's, we believe the best way to understand the scene is to look at where the industry is now, and progressively uncovering its history as you learn more. 

This page is **not** a general reference document for artists, their music, or their labels. This page is structured to guide your introduction to Korean hip-hop, and points you to reference sources – but we are not any sort of encyclopedia or wiki. 

This page is **not** a music review site. While we have lists of essential songs and albums, this is reflective of their importance to the genre or culture and is not any attempt to give them a rating or a ranking.

This page **is** meant to provide you with essential knowledge of the _present-day_ scene. This means that you'll get to know the biggest, most important names – so that you'll be equipped to discover more by yourself. There's a lot to cover since it's still a growing and diversifying industry!

This page **is** designed with no knowledge of hip-hop or Korean in mind beyond basic 한글. It really is an introduction to the scene, and should be easy to read if you are interested in the subject.

This page **is** a one-man operation – I sincerely apologize if there are any errors or omissions, please lt me know if there's anything I can do to make it better!
