# A Mainstream History
## The 90s: Hip-hop enters Korea

Elements of hip-hop were first introduced to the mainstream in the early 90s by acts like **서태지와 아이들** and **DEUX**. They took strong influences from the new jack swing genre pioneered by producer Teddy Riley and popularized by artists like Bobby Brown and Michael Jackson – these early hits were uptempo, performance-oriented songs, with the artists often beginning their careers as dancers rather than musicians. Accordingly, 서태지와 아이들's 1992 debut with "난 알아요" was a seminal moment in the history of not only Korean hip-hop but also K-pop.

As the success of Seo Taiji led to a proliferation of rapping boy bands – **H.O.T**, **Sechskies(젝스키스)**, and **1TYM** among them – acts focusing more on music than dance began to appear on the scene. One of the earliest successful albums unambiguously regarded today as hip-hop is 1999's _Year of the Tiger_ by Korean-American duo **Drunken Tiger**. Rapping takes up a significant portion of the runtime compared to music by idol groups, and developments in rhyme scheme are apparent.

## The 00s: Hip-hop enters the mainstream

By the late 90s and early 00s, hip-hop had developed a large fanbase through early internet forums and performance venues. And while many acts continued to model themselve after American rappers, new strains of hip-hop began to appear aligning more with Korean sensibilities. Leading this group were the teams of **Dynamicduo**, **Epik High**, and **리쌍**, who had roots in the underground scene (and links to Drunken Tiger) but found massive mainstream success with more mainstream-oriented sounds. These groups were also notable for lyricism that focused on storytelling, often featuring philosophical elements, as well as melodic choruses more palatable to the general public.

Some rappers would incorporate orchestral arrangements popular in ballads and drama OSTs, creating sounds unique to the Korean scene. While this was a brief trend – and somewhat derided by present-day purists – the strings-and-beats formula created some of the most successful songs of the late 2000s, including **BIGBANG**'s "거짓말" and "하루하루" as well as **Outsider**'s smash hit "외톨이":

## The 10s: Hip-hop _becomes_ the mainstream

By this point hip-hop had escaped (to the dismay of some fans) its niche underground status, and collaborations between rappers and K-pop stars became increasingly common. While artists like **Geeks**, **San E**, and **Mad Clown** were also known in the scene for their rap material, to the general public they were identified by more melodical mainstream hits featuring sanitized, inoffensive lyrics.

Inevitably, the television industry wanted a share of the pie – and in 2012, **Mnet**, owned by megacorporation CJ ENM, launched _Show Me The Money_. Coming at height of Korea's audition program fad (exemplified by _Superstar K_ and _K-pop Star_), the series exploded in popularity beginning in season 3 (won by **Bobby**) and since then has [routinely sent songs](https://theqoo.net/square/2250160733) to the top of the charts. While the resulting commercialization of hip-hop faces constant criticism from the artists and listeners alike, the series is responsible for lifting dozens of artists into superstardom and should be credited for hip-hop becoming a cultural mainstay.

A promotional video released featuring season 6's judges ("producers") offers a great look at the history of Korean hip-hop all in once place:

- Zico and Dean, who were the trendsetters pioneering a unique domestic sound;
- Dynamicduo, who helped prove hip-hop was commercially viable in the 2000s;
- Jay Park and Dok2, who were label CEOs aligned more to American styles;
- Bizzy and Tiger JK, who brought hip-hop, and not just rap, to Korea in the 90s
